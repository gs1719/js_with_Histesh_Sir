## to run this in codespaces virtual machine

- Add dev configuration files using (f1)command palette  -> all definition -> nodejs &javascript -> Select version

- rebuild option comes at the bottom right corner rebuild it 

- you have your [devcontianer.json] (.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file (configuration file) 

 - can also add your configurations inside that file as we have in the sir's [:file_folder: file](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary/js-hindi-youtube/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)

- to run this we need to run it with the folder or dir path and file name .js So we have to write like this To save to the repo we need to push it using left hand side git icon
- at last, it is a good practice to close or delete your machine from [codespaces](https://github.com/kd2-80161/js_with_Histesh_Sir/codespaces) as it has a limited no of free hours in a month
